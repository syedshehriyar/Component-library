			Everything in today's world is on internet today.It's an integrated part
			of our life now!. But, how well do we know what happens behind the
			screens? not much really. Lets see an overview... 1. What is the internet
			? It is made up of millions of computers all over the world that are
			digitally connected to each other by cable, fibre or wireless links. You
			can use the internet to browse websites, communicate with people, download
			pictures and videos, listen to music or do lots of other amazing things.
			But have you ever wondered how the internet works? image Hello Miss
			Pigeon. You probably use the internet to coo to your pigeon friends on
			Tweeter! But have you ever wondered how it really works? If every bird’s
			nest was a computer, then the internet would be like connecting every
			bird’s nest together so they could all talk to each other. In computing
			speak, that’s called a network. But it’s not enough just to connect the
			nests together. The birds have to agree how they’ll use the connections
			too. Including how a message will be addressed and how it will get passed
			on. On the internet, these rules are called protocols. But what if you
			want to send something that’s too big? You would need to break it up into
			small pieces to get it there. The internet works in exactly the same way,
			but these small pieces are called packets. Each packet includes
			instructions about how it fits together and details about where it came
			from and where it is going. Each computer on the internet has a unique
			numeric address called an IP address, and these can be looked up
			automatically using a Domain Name Server, which is like a giant address
			book. When we have an address, the packets get guided through the internet
			by routers, which pass them along like a baton in a relay race. When the
			delivery arrives, the instructions explain how to put all the packets back
			together. Perfect! 3. Making a request ? So how does information move
			around the internet? Let’s imagine you are visiting a webpage with an
			image on it. How does the image get to your computer? Sending a request
			The image is hosted on a web server. Your computer sends a request to the
			web server for the image. The request is sent in a ‘packet’. A packet is
			like a virtual parcel which has lots of important information attached to
			it. The two most important bits of information are the IP address of the
			web server that the image is stored on and the IP address of your
			computer. Special computers called routers, and devices called switches,
			direct the packet from your computer to the web server. The web server
			might be close by or on the other side of the world. Around the world The
			packet can be sent across the world through fibre optic cables under the
			sea or even by satellite. 4. Receiving information ? his case ‘please send
			me this image’. Images are often quite large so they need to be split up
			into lots of packets, often hundreds or thousands of them. All of these
			packets include information about how they should be put back together as
			well as where they are going and where they came from. Different routes
			The web server sends these packets back to your computer and once again
			routers and switches direct them. The routers try to find the fastest
			possible route for each packet. They might take different routes and might
			not arrive in the same order they were sent. Putting the packets back
			together Now that all the packets have been received the information
			attached to them tells your computer how to put them back together and the
			image will display on your screen. This whole process of sending a request
			and receiving the packets usually takes less than a second! 5. Glossary
			Data packets : When information is being sent from one computer to another
			it is broken down into small bits of data called 'packets'. Each packet
			includes information about where the data is going to, where it is from
			and how to reassemble it. IP address : Computers use an IP address
			(Internet Protocol address) to identify each other. It's a bit like a
			postcode that is unique to each computer connected to the internet. An IP
			address is a set of numbers that might look like this: 195.188.87.10.
			Switch : A smart device that connects together many different devices so
			they can act as a network. Sometimes simpler devices called 'hubs' are
			used. Router : A smart device that directs or routes information around
			the internet. When a data packet arrives the router reads the IP address
			information and sends the packet along the best route to its destination.
			DNS : The DNS (Domain Name System) is a set of standards for how computers
			exchange data on the Internet. The DNS turns a user-friendly domain names
			like BBC - Homepage into an Internet Protocol (IP) address. that's how
			this sea of information woks...
